## Borders

The border shorthand property sets all the border properties in one declaration. 
```css 
    border: 1px solid #000;
```

The properties that can be set, are (in order): 
1. border-width
2. border-style
3. border-color.

It does not matter if one of the values above are missing,for eg: 

```css 
    border: solid red;
```
The above code is also valid CSS.
